### Data Flow

News fetching and AI summarization are proxied through the Express server (`server/app.ts`, routes `GET /api/news` and `POST /api/summarize`) so the GNews and Groq keys stay server-side and are never bundled into the browser. In development, the same Express app is mounted as Vite dev-server middleware (see `vitePluginApiRoutes` in `vite.config.ts`), so `pnpm dev` alone is enough — no separate API process needed.

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (with pnpm)
- GNews API key (free tier): https://gnews.io/register
- Groq API key: https://console.groq.com/

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd narrate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Edit `.env.local` and add your API keys:
   ```
   GNEWS_API_KEY=your_gnews_api_key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

   Both keys are read server-side only (by the Express API routes), so they're never bundled into the browser JS.

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build   # builds the Vite client and bundles the Express server into dist/
pnpm start   # runs the production server (serves dist/public)
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- **All data stored locally** in browser localStorage
- **No server-side tracking** of user activity
- **No personal information** collected or transmitted
- **API keys stored securely** in environment variables
- **Bookmarks, summaries, and history** never leave your device

## 🚦 Performance

- **Server Components** for optimal data fetching
- **Dynamic imports** for code splitting
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image
- **Lazy loading** for off-screen content
- **Caching** with 30-minute TTL
- **Streaming** for AI summaries
- **Memoization** to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## 🧪 Development

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript strict mode** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code consistency
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **No hardcoded strings** (all in constants)
- **Reusable components** and hooks

### Testing

```bash
pnpm check    # TypeScript check
pnpm format   # Format code
```

## 📦 Deployment

The client is a static Vite build; the API (`GET /api/news`, `POST /api/summarize`) runs two ways depending on platform:

- **Railway / Render**: the Express server in `server/index.ts` serves both the static build and the API routes as one persistent process.
- **Vercel**: `api/news.ts` and `api/summarize.ts` are Vercel serverless functions (using the same `server/lib/newsClient.ts` and `server/lib/groqClient.ts` logic), and `vercel.json` points Vercel at the `dist/public` build output with an SPA rewrite for client-side routing.

Both paths read the same two env vars server-side only — never exposed to the browser.

### Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import the repository at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) (Vite framework preset is auto-detected)
3. Add `GNEWS_API_KEY` and `GROQ_API_KEY` as environment variables (Project Settings → Environment Variables)
4. Deploy — `vercel.json` already sets the correct build command and output directory

### Railway / Render

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Create a new service and connect the repository
3. Set the build command to `pnpm install && pnpm build`
4. Set the start command to `pnpm start`
5. Add `GNEWS_API_KEY` and `GROQ_API_KEY` as environment variables
6. Deploy

### Other Platforms

Any host that runs a long-lived Node process also works: DigitalOcean App Platform, Fly.io, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, etc. — same setup as Railway/Render.
